# Zed - Fork

[![Zed](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zed-industries/zed/main/assets/badge/v0.json)](https://zed.dev)
[![CI](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/actions/workflows/run_tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/actions/workflows/run_tests.yml)

Welcome to Zed, a high-performance, multiplayer code editor from the creators of [Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom) and [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter).

### Fork Changes
- Updated the logos for all release channels (`crates/zed/resources/`) <sup>*</sup>
- Modified the look and feel of the scrollbar in the ui (not the editor) ([scrollbar.rs](./crates/ui/src/components/scrollbar.rs))
- Removed all instances of gradient fade truncation with proper ellipsis(...) truncation ([agent_panel.rs](./crates/agent_ui/src/agent_panel.rs), [sidebar.rs](./crates/sidebar/src/sidebar.rs), [thread_item.rs](./crates/ui/src/components/ai/thread_item.rs), [thread_view.rs](./crates/agent_ui/src/conversation_view/thread_view.rs))
- Custom Github release builds ([sync_and_release.yml](./.github/workflows/sync_and_release.yml))
- Updated internal Zed updater to download binaries from the Github releases of this fork ([sync_and_release.yml](./.github/workflows/sync_and_release.yml), [auto_update.rs](./crates/auto_update/src/auto_update.rs), [auto_update_ui.rs](./crates/auto_update_ui/src/auto_update_ui.rs), [github.rs](./crates/http_client/src/github.rs))
- Repositioned the agent prompt floating edit-controls button to the bottom-right of the message and wrapped it in `deferred()` to fix a paint-order issue where the edit backdrop overlay would cover the buttons ([thread_view.rs](./crates/agent_ui/src/conversation_view/thread_view.rs))
- Fork release notes are shown inside the app (fetched from this fork's Github releases) instead of upstream's release-notes API, and the "open in browser" fallback points to this fork's Github releases page ([auto_update.rs](./crates/auto_update/src/auto_update.rs), [auto_update_ui.rs](./crates/auto_update_ui/src/auto_update_ui.rs), [github.rs](./crates/http_client/src/github.rs))

### Licensing

Zed source code is licensed primarily under GPL-3.0-or-later, with Apache-2.0 components where marked.

License information for third party dependencies must be correctly provided for CI to pass.

We use [`cargo-about`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-about) to automatically comply with open source licenses. If CI is failing, check the following:

- Is it showing a `no license specified` error for a crate you've created? If so, add `publish = false` under `[package]` in your crate's Cargo.toml.
- Is the error `failed to satisfy license requirements` for a dependency? If so, first determine what license the project has and whether this system is sufficient to comply with this license's requirements. If you're unsure, ask a lawyer. Once you've verified that this system is acceptable add the license's SPDX identifier to the `accepted` array in `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`.
- Is `cargo-about` unable to find the license for a dependency? If so, add a clarification field at the end of `script/licenses/zed-licenses.toml`, as specified in the [cargo-about book](https://embarkstudios.github.io/cargo-about/cli/generate/config.html#crate-configuration).
